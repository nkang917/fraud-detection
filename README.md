## Project overview 
We will be detecting credit card fraud based on the different features of our dataset.

• Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict fraudulent transactions and designed a real-time alert system to prevent fraudulent activities.\
• Performed exploratory data analysis on 138K+ transactions and preprocessed data by removing duplicates, encoding categorical features and handling imbalanced labeled data by SMOTE.\
• Built logistic regression and random forest models, optimized hyper-parameters via k-fold cross-validation.\
• Evaluated model performance of classification (F1 score: 0.69) and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors.


## Summary of Fraud Detection

• Data is highly imbalanced\
• Features of interval_after_signup and time related raw and aggregates are highly predictive of fraud\
• Made actionable operation recommendations/proposal for business
