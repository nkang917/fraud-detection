# Financial-Anomaly-Detection-and-Risk-Analysis
We will be detecting credit card fraud based on the different features of our dataset.

1. Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict fraudulent transactions and designed a real-time alert system to prevent fraudulent activities.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis on 138K+ transactions and preprocessed data by removing duplicates, encoding categorical features and handling imbalanced labeled data by SMOTE.
3. Built logistic regression and random forest models, optimized hyper-parameters via k-fold cross-validation.
4. Evaluated model performance of classification (F1 score: 0.69) and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors.


Summary of Fraud Detection

1. Data is highly imbalanced
2. Features of interval_after_signup and time related raw and aggregates are highly predictive of fraud
3. Made actionable operation recommendations/proposal for business
